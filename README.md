**Smart Bandage Project**

This project utilizes the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 to develop a smart bandage that measures and displays temperature and humidity in real-time using Bluetooth and NFC communication.

## File Structure

- **MediBand.html**
  - Main web page file.
  - Displays temperature and humidity in real-time and visualizes the data using graphs.

- **plot.html**
  - Test file for graph functionality.
  - Used to verify proper graph rendering based on sensor data.

- **real.html**
  - Test file for Bluetooth communication.
  - Displays only temperature and humidity values.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Acquisition**: Retrieves temperature and humidity data from the sensor.
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Displays data from the smart bandage on a web browser.
- **Graph Visualization**: Enables visual analysis of past data.
- **NFC Integration (Planned)**: Exploring the addition of NFC-based data transfer.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing data storage functionality
- Enhancing mobile compatibility
- Developing and testing NFC features
- Improving sensor data accuracy

This project is currently under development, and feedback is highly welcome!
